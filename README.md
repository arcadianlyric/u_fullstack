1. Fyyur: Artist Booking Site  
To create a booking site Fyyur that facilitates bookings between artists who can play at venues, and venues who want to book artists.  
The site is capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:  
1) creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.  
2) searching for venues and artists.  
3) learning more about a specific artist or venue.  

2. Trivia API  
To create a trivia app to hold trivia quiz, pop up questions and calculate scores. The application must:  
1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.  
2) Delete questions.  
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.  
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.  

3. Coffee Shop  
To create a full stack drink menu application for a coffee shop. The application must:  
1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.  
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.  
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
